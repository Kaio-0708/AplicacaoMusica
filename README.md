## üìÑ Description

This Java project is a simple application for managing music and podcasts, with features for playing and enjoying audio, as well as classifying and listing user preferences. The project is organized into different classes to represent audios, songs, and podcasts, and includes functionalities for interacting with the audios.

- **`classification` (int)**: Audio classification.

#### Methods:
- **`getTitle()`**: Returns the title of the audio.
- **`setTitle(String title)`**: Sets the title of the audio.

- **`getTotalLikes()`**: Returns the total number of likes for the audio.
- **`getClassification()`**: Returns the audio classification.
- **`like()`**: Increases the total number of likes.
- **`reproduce()`**: Increments the total number of reproductions.

- **`setSinger(String singer)`**: Sets the singer of the song.
- **`getGenre()`**: Returns the musical genre.
- **`setGenre(String genre)`**: Sets the musical genre.
- **`getTotalReproductions()`**: Overrides the method to return a ranking based on total reproductions (10 if more than 2000 reproductions, otherwise 8).

### üéôÔ∏è `Podcast` Class
The `Podcast` class also extends the `Audio` class and adds attributes specific to podcasts.

#### Attributes:

### üè† `Main` Class
